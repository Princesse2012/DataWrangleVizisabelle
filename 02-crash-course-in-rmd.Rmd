# Crash Course in R Markdown

This document is intended to help you quickly learn how to generate
reproducible data analysis and results using R Markdown.

An accompanying YouTube playlist that walks through this document is
available by following the link
[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkrJrLs7xfbXJ0F9yc-n8PzvoFv4qmM-N).
I have also included direct, relevant video links throughout the file
(e.g., immediately after the the relevant heading). An html version of
this document can be downloaded to your current working direction (run
`getwd()` in the Console to see where this is) by running the following
command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfrench/DataWrangleViz/master/02-crash-course-in-rmd.html",
              "02-crash-course-in-rmd.html")
```

Note that there may be small differences between this document (which is
easy to update) and the videos (which are not). When there is a
discrepancy, trust this document more than the video.

## What is R Markdown? ([Overview video](https://youtu.be/mcTB7h9lpCg))

R Markdown is a tool for dynamic, reproducible creation of data-centric
documents that include text, code, the results of executed code.

-   R Markdown was created by R Studio (<https://www.rstudio.com>) in
    2014 (or at least that's the oldest discussion I can find).
-   It is a variant of Markdown, which was created by John Gruber
    (creator of Daring Fireball (<https://daringfireball.net/>)) and
    Aaron Swartz (co-creator of Reddit
    ([https://www.reddit.com/](https://www.reddit.com)) as a lightweight
    markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text
    editor.
-   In general, a markdown language is a language that is written in
    plain-text but that is rendered different based on "markups" in the
    text.
-   Has some capabilities similar to Jupyter (<https://jupyter.org/>)
    notebooks.

R Markdown is a great way to:

-   Create a data analysis notebook that documents how and why you did
    analysis a certain way.
-   Share your work with others in a variety of formats.
-   Make your work reproducible.

R Markdown is a very useful tool for the data scientist.

R Studio provides R Markdown (and other) cheatsheets at
<https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/>

### Your turn

The easiest way to create a new R Markdown file in R Studio is File →
New File → R Markdown. Do this on your computer to see what is produced.

## What's in an R Markdown document?

An R Markdown document has three components:

1.  An optional YAML header.
2.  Formatted text.
3.  **Chunks** of computer code.

Since the YAML header is optional, we'll talk about it last.

## Formatting text in R Markdown

### Commenting code ([Comments video](https://youtu.be/K-CCEx2tbHI))

Note: In R Scripts and the R Console, the `#` symbol denotes a comment.
In R Markdown files (.Rmd or .rmd), a comment is created by placing
`<!--` and `-->` to the left and right, respectively, of the text you
want to comment.

e.g.,

    <!-- comment text -->

would comment the text "comment text".

The easiest way to comment text in R Markdown documents is to highlight
the text and then press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + c`.

### Your turn

Practice commenting some text in R Markdown.

### Headings and sections ([Formatting video](https://youtu.be/K-CCEx2tbHI))

Headings and sections of different levels are created with `#`.

-   `#` indicates the first level
-   `##` being the second level
-   etc.

The words after the `#` will be larger than the regular text.

### Font styles and effects

-   *Italic text*: `*text*` or `_text_`.
-   **Bold text**: `**text**` or `__text__` (two underscores on each
    side)
-   `Typewriter (code) text`: `` `text` ``
-   Endash (--), emdash (---): `--` and `---`.
-   ^superscript^ and ~subscript~: `^superscript^` and `~subscript~`
-   ~~strikethrough~~: `~~strikethrough~~`
-   Escaping special characters \*, \_, \$, \\, `` ` ``: `\*`, `\_`,
    `\$`, `\\`, ``` `` ` `` ```
-   Footnote[^1]: `Footnote^[This is a footnote]`

[^1]: This is a footnote

Math is rendered using LaTeX (which is
[pronounced](https://www.latex-project.org/about/) "Lah-tech" or
"Lay-tech"). So you can use \$ and \$\$ to render inline math and
display math like you would in LaTeX.

E.g., Typing "The regression coefficient \$\\beta\$" will produce "The
regression coefficient $\beta$".

### Your turn

1.  Create a new R Script (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + n`).
2.  Replace the file contents with the code below:

``` {eval="FALSE"}
---
title: "Bad jokes"
output: html_notebook
---

# First level

## Second level

### Third level

This document is intended to help you see the effect of markup on a rendered document.
  
*This is italic text*

**This is bold text**

`This looks like computer code`

What's the difference between endash--endash and emdash---emdash?

How can I add a superscript to this? Like this: this^superscript^?

That's a joke if you didn't get the ~subtext~. 

Wow, two bad jokes in a row. I'd like to strike ~~that~~ from my memory.

I wish I could \*escape\* these bad jokes.

But I guess this will just be an unpleasant footnote^[unpleasant footnote].
```

3.  Save the file (`Ctrl/Cmd + s`) with the name "bad_jokes.Rmd".
4.  Click the Preview button and view the results.

## Numbered/ordered and unordered lists ([Lists video](https://youtu.be/ME80PeaMBF4))

### Numbered/ordered lists

Numbered lists with sub-bullets:

    A numbered list with subnumbering.

    1. Item 1
        a. Sub-item 1 # two tabs, not one
        b. Sub-item 2
            i. Sub-sub-item 1 # four tabs, not two
    2. Item 2
        a. Sub-item 1

Result: A numbered list with subnumbering.

1.  Item 1
    a.  Sub-item 1
    b.  Sub-item 2
        i.  Sub-sub-item 1
2.  Item 2
    a.  Sub-item 1

Note: There must be a line between any text and the number `1`.

### Unordered lists

Unordered lists with sub-bullets:

    Some text with bullets.

    * Item 1
      * Sub-item 1
      * Sub-item 2
        * Sub-sub-item 1
    * Item 2
      * Sub-item 1

Result: Some text with bullets.

-   Item 1
    -   Sub-item 1
    -   Sub-item 2
        -   Sub-sub-item 1
-   Item 2
    -   Sub-item 1

Notes:

-   There must be a line between any text and the \*.
-   You can use `+` or `-` instead of `*` when creating unordered lists
    with the same result.

### Your turn

Create an example of a numbered list with 4 levels and an unordered list
with 3 levels.

## Code chunks ([Code chunks video](https://youtu.be/_jVqqTGfmB0))

Chunks of code can be added in an R Markdown by placing the relevant
code between ```` ```{r} ```` and ```` ``` ````. e.g.,

    ```{r, label = chunk_name}`r ''`
    1 + 1
    ```

You can generate a code chunk template using `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + i`.

The `chunk_name` is optional but allows you give give chunks names
labels that you can refer back to. This is useful for complicated
documents and reports. (See Verbatim Code Chunks
<https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/verbatim-code-chunks.html>
to learn how to render the above code.)

Note: each label should be unique within the document. I don't recommend
adding chunk labels unless you actually need them, otherwise you are
likely to reuse a chunk label and make a headache for yourself!

### Chunk options ([Chunk options video](https://youtu.be/Fq7H_qt2K4g))

Code chunks have many options that can be used to customize the code. We
will cover many important ones below. I will specify the default option
in parentheses, (), after the option. So this is what will be used by
default if you don't specify anything.

Yuhui Xie, creator of **knitr**, provides a complete list
(<https://yihui.org/knitr/options/>) of chunk options on his website
(<https://yihui.org/>).

### Code evaluation

-   `eval`: (`TRUE`) A logical value indicating whether the chunk should
    be evaluated in the Console.
    -   You can also evaluate **selected lines** if you provide a
        numeric vector. e.g., `eval = 1:3` would evaluate lines 1
        through 3.

### Text output

-   `echo`: (`TRUE`). A logical value indicating whether the source code
    should be displayed.
    -   You can also echo **selected lines** if you provide a numeric
        vector. e.g., `echo = 1:3` would echolines 1 through 3
-   `results`: (`'markup'`). Determines hwo the results are displayed.
    -   Other options are `'asis'`, `'hold'`, `'hide'`.
-   `collapse`: (`FALSE`). A logical value indicating whether the source
    and output should be collapsed into a single block.
-   `include`: (`TRUE`) A logical value indicating whether to include
    the chunk output.
    -   Set to `FALSE` when you want something to run but not be shown.

Other options: `warning`, `error`, `messages` (`TRUE`) determine whether
warnings, errors, and messages will be displayed, respectively.

### Code styling

-   `highlight`: (`TRUE`) A logical value indicating whether the source
    code syntax should be highlighted with different colors.
-   `comment`: (`##`) The text that will be shown prior to evaluated
    code in the output block.
    -   Use `##` or `#>` to make the code blocks easier to copy and
        paste into the Console. `#>` is closer to what the Console
        output actually looks like.
-   `tidy`: (`FALSE`) A logical value indicating whether the source code
    be automatically reformatted.
-   `tidy.opts`: (`NULL`) A list of options that can be used to
    customize the `tidy` option above.
    -   e.g., `tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 60)` controls the length
        of the code and tries to cut the code lines at 60 characters.

### Plots

-   `fig.show`: (`'asis'`). Instructions for displaying plots.
    -   `'asis'`: Show plots in the order and places they would be if
        executed in the Console.
    -   `'hold'`: Output all plots at the end of the chunk.
    -   `'hide'`: Hide all plots.
    -   `'animate'`: Combine and animate the plots
-   `fig.align`: (`'default'`). A character vector specifying how to
    align the figures.
    -   Allowable values are: `'default'`, `'left'`, `'right'`, and
        `'center'`.
-   `fig.width`, `fig.height`: (7). A numeric value indicating the width
    and height of the result figures.
-   `fig.cap`: (`NULL`). A caption for the figure.

### Your turn ([Chunk option visualization](https://youtu.be/teiwbKIfUnY))

Copy and paste the code at
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfrench/DataWrangleViz/master/rmd-chunks-viz.Rmd>
into an R Markdown document and then Knit the file to see visual
examples of the options described above.

### Some general options not discussed

-   Caching: This has to do with saving previous code that has been
    evaluated. This is important for documents with lots of code that is
    time consuming to run.
-   Animation: You can add plot animations if you have the FFMpeg
    program installed (<https://ffmpeg.org/>.)

### Inline code

You can run code in the middle of text using something like
`` `r knitr::inline_expr("mean(1:3)")` ``.

For example, `` `r knitr::inline_expr("1 + 1")` `` will produce
`r 1 + 1`.

### Tables

By default, R will print tables (like data frames) exactly like you
would see them in the Console output.

For example:

    ```{r}`r ''`
    head(cars)
    ```

```{r}
head(cars)
```

The formatting can be improved with the `kable` function in the
**knitr** package.

    ```{r}`r ''`
    knitr::kable(cars[1:6,], caption = "Kable table")
    ```

```{r}
knitr::kable(cars[1:6,], caption = "Kable table")
```

**Markdown tables** ([Markdown tables
video](https://youtu.be/Rp1EGDY3ZkQ))

Tables can be directly created in Markdown using extended syntax
(<https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/>). These are most
useful for small tables that require very specific formatting and don't
have many rows or columns.

Basic structure:

-   The first two rows of a Markdown table provide the table's header
    (the column names and alignment.)
-   The remaining rows provide the rest of the table's data.

Additional details:

-   The pipe (`|`) is used to separate the table columns and column
    names in the first row.

-   The pipe and three (or more) hyphens (`---`) between pipes are used
    in the second row to create a line between the column names and the
    values in the table.

-   The colon (`:`) can be used in the second row to align the columns.

    -   `:---` produces a left-aligned column.
    -   `---:` produces a right-aligned column.
    -   `:---:` produces a center-aligned column.

-   You can use more than three hyphens or spaces to align the columns
    visually.

-   The remaining values in the table are placed between pipes and can
    be formatted similar to other text.

-   Make sure each row begins and ends with a pipe.

A simple example is provided below. If we include the following code in
our R Markdown document:

    | Coefficient | Estimate | Est. Standard Error |
    | :---------- | -------: | :---:               |
    | (Intercept) | 3.2      | 1.6                 |
    | $\beta_1$   | *1.5*    | **2.7**             | 
    | X2          | 9.4      | ~~0.6~~             |

then the following output will be rendered:

| Coefficient | Estimate | Est. Standard Error |
|:------------|---------:|:-------------------:|
| (Intercept) |      3.2 |         1.6         |
| $\beta_1$   |    *1.5* |       **2.7**       |
| X2          |      9.4 |       ~~0.6~~       |

Notice the alignment and formatting of the text based on the code above.

## YAML header basics ([YAML header basics video](https://youtu.be/JgH_rIJUqZ8))

The YAML (Yet Another Markdown Language) header controls many aspects of
the R Markdown document.

We only discuss some of the basic details of YAML headers below. If you
do need to know about the YAML header in detail, then you probably need
a more advanced introduction to R Markdown!

The YAML header is provided at the top of an R Markdown document between
sets of 3 dashes:

    ---
    some info here ...
    ---

The YAML header allows you to specify:

-   `title`: The title of the document, which is displayed in font
    larger than the section headings or main text.
-   `author`: The author of the document. This is displayed just below
    the title.
-   `date`: The date. You can use
    `` date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%Y-%m-%d')`" `` to display the
    current date automatically.
-   `output`: The output type produced when knitting the document.
-   `bibliography`: Link to bibliography files to enable citations.

Here is the exact YAML header used at this beginning of this document:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
---
title: "Joshua French"
date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%Y-%m-%d')`"
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2: default
  bookdown::html_notebook2: default
bibliography:
- crash-rmd.bib
- packages_crashrmd.bib
---
```

Looking over the YAML, you may notice:

-   I've replaced the title with my name (for formatting reasons).
-   I automatically update the date based on when the document is
    compiled.
-   I have have two different document output types.
-   I'm using two different bibliography files.

You can specify additional arguments to the document output types by
adding an indented newline after the document type. E.g., the following
YAML code would indicate not to number the sections of the document.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
output:   
  bookdown::html_document2:
    number_sections: false
```

We do not go into further detail about the YAML

### R Markdown output types

One of the incredible features of R Markdown is that you can easily
produce multiple output types with a single click of the
`r knitr::include_graphics("./figures/knit_button.png")` button. Some of
the main document output types are:

-   `pdf_document`: Excellent for distributing a static (unchanging)
    document. Also great for submitting homework solutions to your
    instructor!
-   `html_document`: Excellent for sharing interactive files. Can be
    viewed in a web browser.
-   `html_notebook`: The excellent "R notebook".
    -   It's like an `html_document` but the source code can be
        downloaded by toggling the "Code" button in the upper right hand
        corner of the file.
    -   Great to share with collaborators because they can update the
        document, add analysis, etc.
    -   Make sure to "Run All Code" using `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + r` prior to
        "Preview" the document or the code chunk output will not be
        included.
-   `word_document`: If for some reason you need Microsoft Word editing
    capabilities.

Adding the following code in the YAML header will produce a pdf
document, an html notebook, an html document, and a Microsoft Word
document, all with one click of the Knit button!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
output:
  pdf_document: default
  html_notebook: default
  html_document:
    df_print: paged
  word_document: default
```

Additional output document formats are available by default through the
**rmarkdown** package [@R-rmarkdown]:

-   `context_document`
-   `github_document`
-   `latex_document`
-   `md_document`
-   `odt_document`
-   `rtf_document`

The **rmarkdown** package also provides several presentation outputs:

-   `beamer_presentation`
-   `ioslides_presentation`
-   `powerpoint_presentation`
-   `slidy_presentation`

For presentations, you generally:

-   Use `#` to start a new slide with a title.
-   Use `***` to start a new slide without a title.
-   Use `##` for a second level header.
-   Add text, graphics, and math like a typical R Markdown document.

If you are in need of automatically-linked cross-references (referring
to figures, tables, equations, sections, etc.), then the **bookdown**
package [@bookdown2022] package provides the document types that extend
the ones mentioned above:

-   `bookdown::pdf_document2`
-   `bookdown::html_document2`
-   `bookdown::html_notebook2`
-   `bookdown::word_document2`

You can work with these documents in the same way as the standard R
Markdown documents, but with additional cross-referencing capabilities.

R packages provide additional output types:

-   Shiny apps: the **shiny** package [@R-shiny] allows you to create
    shiny apps, which are interactive web apps.
-   Websites: `rmarkdown::render_site()` function can be used to create
    websites.
-   Books: The **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] provides several book
    formats.
-   Blogs: The **blogdown** package [@R-blogdown] can be used to create
    books.
-   Dashboards: The **flexdashboard** package [@R-flexdashboard] can be
    used to create interactive dashboards.
-   html_widgets: various packages

### Your turn

In this example, we see the difference between an html document and an
html notebook.

-   Execute the following command in the Console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfrench/DataWrangleViz/master/02-crash-course-in-rmd.nb.html", 
destfile = "02-crash-course-in-rmd.nb.html")
```

-   Find the downloaded file on your computer and open it.
-   Toggle the "Code" button in the right hand corner of the file to
    download the original source code.

## Citations {#sec-citations}

A good data scientist will appropriately acknowledge sources of
information or resources they use to produce their work. This
acknowledgment is known as a citation and the act of acknowledgment is
"citing" someone's work. Citations can be added to an R Markdown
document through the YAML header.

To cite something in R Markdown, you must have a file containing your
references. Your references can be stored in one of two ways
[@bookdown2016]:

-   A `bib` file using BibTeX or BibLaTeX format.
-   A `csl` file using the Citation Style Language
    (<https://citationstyles.org/>).

We will briefly discuss citing references in the BibTeX format.

BibTeX is a reference manager (like Zotero or Mendeley).

-   References are stored in separate `.bib` file, making it easier to
    separate the presentation of citations from their storage.
-   BibTeX is widely used to manage references when creating documents
    in LaTeX, but it can also be used in other settings (such as R
    Markdown documents).
-   The BibTeX website (<https://www.bibtex.com>) is an excellent source
    of information about using BibTeX.

The key ingredients to a BibTeX reference are the:

1.  *entry* type
2.  *citekey*
3.  additional entry *fields*.

The *entry* type indicates the type of document you are citing. There
are currently 14 entry types. The most common entry types are:

-   `article`: journal or magazine articles.
-   `book`: an physical or online book.
-   `manual`: technical documentation, like for an R package.
-   `misc`: when none of the other entry types apply. This is commonly
    used for websites.

The *citekey* is a unique identifier for a specific reference.

-   Make the citekey a short but descriptive identifier of the
    reference.
-   E.g., `rotk` might refer to *Return of the King*, the 3rd novel in
    J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy.

The *fields* are specific pieces of information needed for each entry
type. Different entry types require different information. Nearly all
entry types require the following fields:

-   `title`: the title of the reference item.
-   `author`: the person, persons, or organization that created the
    reference item.
-   `year`: the year the reference item was produced.

Refer to (<https://www.bibtex.com/g/bibtex-format/>) for additional
fields.

In what follows, let's assume we have BibTeX references stored in a file
`crash-rmd.bib` (that's literally the `.bib` file I'm using for this
document). `crash-rmd.bib` contains two citation entries, which are
produced exactly below:

    @Manual{bookdown2022,
        title = {bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown},
        author = {Yihui Xie},
        year = {2022},
        note = {R package version 0.27},
        url = {https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown},
    }

    @Book{sp2013,
      author = {Roger S. Bivand and Edzer Pebesma and Virgilio Gomez-Rubio},
      title = {Applied spatial data analysis with {R}, Second edition},
      year = {2013},
      publisher = {Springer, NY},
      url = {https://asdar-book.org/},
    }

The first entry is the technical manual for the **bookdown** package.
The citekey for that reference is `bookdown2022`. The second entry is a
for a book related to doing spatial statistics in R. The citekey for
that book is `sp2013`.

The `.bib` file should be in the same directory as the document citing
the entries. In your YAML header, you must add the following line to
link the `.bib` file with your document:

    bibliography: filename.bib

where `filename` is replaced by the name of your `.bib` file. In our
case, this is `crash-rmd.bib`.

To cite a reference from a `.bib` file:

-   Use `@citekey` to cite the reference as a proper noun, e.g., Astley
    (1987).
-   Use `[@citekey]` to to cite the reference parenthetically, e.g.,
    [Astley 1987].
-   Multiple citations should be separated by semicolons.
-   Add additional information about a reference with commas, e.g.,
    `[@smith2021, Ch. 7]` might produce (Smith 2021, Ch. 7).

R Markdown will automatically add your references at the end of your
document.

We can use the code below to add references to the technical manual for
**bookdown** and the book introducing **bookdown**. We use the pattern
`code`: result produced.

-   `@bookdown2016`: @bookdown2016
-   `[@sp2013]`: [@sp2013]
-   `[@bookdown2016; @sp2013]`: [@bookdown2016; @sp2013]
-   `[@bookdown2016, Section 2.8]` : [@bookdown2016, Section 2.8]

It is possible to change citation styles, use multiple `.bib` files in
one document, have hyperlinks to your references. etc. We do not discuss
those options, but refer you to
<https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/citations.html>.

## Cross-references

To use cross-references in an R Markdown document:

1.  You must use one of the **bookdown** document formats (e.g.,
    `bookdown::html_document2`, `bookdown::html_notebook2`,
    `bookdown::pdf_document2`, etc.)
2.  Create a figure, table, equation, section, etc. with a unique label.
3.  Use the syntax `\@ref(label)` to reference the object, where `label`
    is replaced with the appropriate unique label.

### Figures

To cross-reference a figure:

1.  Include a unique chunk label immediately after the `r` when you
    start your code chunk.
2.  Use the `fig.cap` argument of the code chunk to add a figure
    caption.
3.  Generate a single plot. Technically, you can do more than one, but
    that will make cross-reference more complex.
4.  Use the syntax `\@ref(fig:chunk-label)` in your document (with
    `chunk-label` replaced by the actual label) to cross-reference the
    desired figure. You must include the `fig:` part of the reference.

Additionally, set `echo = FALSE` in the code chunk argument if you don't
want to see the code used to produce the graphic.

Suppose we include the following code chunk in our document:

````{verbatim}
```{r stdnorm-density, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The density of a standard normal distribution."}
x <- seq(-4, 4, len = 1000)
plot(x, dnorm(x), type = "l")
```
````

followed by:

    Consider the standard normal density in Figure \@ref(fig:stdnorm-density).

The result is:

```{r stdnorm-density, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The density of a standard normal distribution."}
x <- seq(-4, 4, len = 1000)
plot(x, dnorm(x), type = "l")
```

Consider the standard normal density in Figure
\@ref(fig:stdnorm-density).

### Tables

To cross-reference a table:

1.  Include a unique chunk label immediately after the `r` when you
    start your code chunk.
2.  Use `knitr::kable` to print a single table.
3.  Use the `caption` argument of `knitr::kable` to add a table caption.
4.  Use the syntax `\@ref(tab:chunk-label)` in your document (with
    `chunk-label` replaced by the actual label) to cross-reference the
    desired table. You must include the `tab:` part of the reference.

Set `echo = FALSE` in the code chunk argument if you don't want to see
the code used to produce the table.

Suppose you added the following text to your document:

````{verbatim}
```{r simple-table, echo = FALSE}
    out_df <- data.frame(observation = 1:3,
                         height = c(69, 72, 70),
                         name = LETTERS[1:3])
    knitr::kable(out_df, caption = "Simple table.")
```
````

followed by:

    Table \@ref(tab:simple-table) provides information about the observations in our data set.

This will produce the following output:

```{r simple-table, echo = FALSE}
out_df <- data.frame(observation = 1:3,
                     height = c(69, 72, 70),
                     name = LETTERS[1:3])
knitr::kable(out_df, caption = "Simple table.")
```

Table \@ref(tab:simple-table) provides information about the
observations in our data set.

### Equations

Now let's discuss cross-referencing a single equation. We provide only
the briefest introduction to using LaTeX to typeset mathematics.

A "display style equation" is an equation that is set off from the rest
of the text. The symbols are often larger, the equation is often
centered, AND you can cross-reference a display style equation.

A display style equation is created between `\[ ... \]` or `$$ ... $$`.
You add the various command to typeset your equation in the `...`. To
cross-reference a display equation, add `(\#eq:label)` where `label` is
replaced by a unique label. When referencing equations, we MUST add
`eq:` before the label. We do not do that for figures or tables.

Consider adding the following text in your document:

    $$
    Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon. (\#eq:slr-model)
    $$

followed by:

    Note the simple linear regression model in Equation \@ref(eq:slr-model).

That will produce the following result:

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon. (\#eq:slr-model)
$$

Note the simple linear regression model in Equation \@ref(eq:slr-model).

### Sections

Cross-referencing a section is the simplest type of cross-reference.
After the section you want to label, add `{#section-label}`, where
`section-label` is a short, unique identifier. E.g., in the document
above, we have the following text:

    ## Citations {#sec-citations}

The text above adds the label `sec-citations` to the subsection
"Citations". To refer to the section, we use the syntax `\@ref(label)`,
where `label` is the unique section label. To cite the "Citation"
section, we would write `\@ref(sec-citations)`.

Adding the following text in your document:

    We discuss citations in Section \@ref(sec-citations).

will result in:

We discuss citations in Section \@ref(sec-citations).

## References {.unnumbered}
